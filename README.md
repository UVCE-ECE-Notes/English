If studied nothing then on the day of exam just go through the most important questions[ click here](https://github.com/UVCE-ECE-Notes/English/blob/main/Most%20Most%20Most%20Important%20Questions.png?raw=true) and remember the answers for each of them, I've also mentioned how much is the minimum no. of questions to study from each part in the WORST CASE, i.e 3 questions.
